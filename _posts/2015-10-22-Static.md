title: static members in c#

### Static Members

“In computer programming, a static variable is a variable that has been allocated statically—whose 
lifetime or "extent" extends across the entire run of the program.”

### Summary

1.	RAM is divided into three areas i.e. stack, heap and static (also known as high frequency heap)
2.	Static methods can only call static members in the class as static can be called even without an instance of a class.
3.	If we define class as static, non-static members or variables will not be allowed. These classes will be by default sealed and cannot be inherited further. Also, these classes cannot be instantiated.
4.	const keyword is implicitly static and need to be initialized while declaring. readonly variables are not implicitly static and only be initialized once.
5.	const cannot be marked explicitly as static. readonly can be marked as static
