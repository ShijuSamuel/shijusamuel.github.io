### Static Members

“In computer programming, a static variable is a variable that has been allocated statically—whose 
lifetime or "extent" extends across the entire run of the program.”

### Overview

- is divided into three areas i.e. stack, heap and static (also known as high frequency heap)
- methods can only call static members in the class as the static can be accessed even
    without intantitiation
- we define class as static, non-static members or variables will not be allowed - These classes
    will be by default sealed and cannot be inherited further. Also, these classes cannot be instantiated
- keyword is implicitly static and need to be initialized while declaring
-  readonly variables are not implicitly static and only be initialized once
- cannot be marked explicitly as static
-  readonly can be marked as static
