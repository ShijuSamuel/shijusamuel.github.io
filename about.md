Welcome to my blog!

I have been a database developer, administrator in Microsoft SQL Server and related technologies for over 12 years. I have started this blog to keep an online presence. This also helps me to keep an online repository to whatever I have learned so far. This enables me to refer things which I have done in past. I am geek in whole sense and interest in technology especially in computing and get bored being in any kind of social gathering. 

Thanks for reading!
